<h1>A Design System that<br />
has never been more <strong>synced</strong>. </h1>

<p>An innovative design system that creates <b>consistent</b> atomic elements ready for any design.</p>

<h2>Why Components?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The components built out in the Stellar Kit adopt standard atomic design principals. Atomic design consists of <strong>atoms</strong>, <strong>molecules</strong>, <strong>organisms</strong>, & <strong>templates</strong> concurrently working together to create effective interface design systems.</p>
<p>Think of atomic design as a mental model to help us keep our components and interfaces a cohesive and nested. Each of the four stages plays a key role in the hierarchy of our interface design systems.</p>
<p>Let's dive into each stage in a bit more detail. When a component being created has multiple foundations + elements, consider referencing below on where to appropriately place them.</p>

<h3>💎  Atoms</h3>
<p>The atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic elements like inputs, buttons, chips and anything else that can't be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.</p>

<h3>💠  Molecules</h3>
<p>Molecules are relatively the first layer of grouped UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, an image, body copy, tags, and button can join together to create a card widget. From a developer perspective, molecules are built using the same object function for the UI element.</p>

<h3>🔷  Organisms</h3>
<p>Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface. For example, header and footer.</p>

<h3>📐  Layouts</h3>
<p>Layout are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure. They combine organisms into a proper website layout.</p>

<h3>📰  Templates</h3>
